# Corona-Virus-Prediction

## Intro
We are a group of students from Multimedia University Malaysia. We are very new to Data Science but we are eager to learn and explore more about it. And so we started our trial project at Hacklytics.

We saw that Covid-19 definitely affected our life in many ways, and it is important to know how long it would sustain in the future. Therefore we decided to try to use a model using linear regression to predict the growth of number of cases. We started with doing some simple analysis of current Covid-19 cases in 2020 Jan 21 - 2021 Feb 4. After collecting some info, we make a 10 days prediction using linear regression. 

Our aim is not to really predict the future, but more about learning Data Science. We hope we could get feedback on our work, and willing to learn about what we can improve in future : D
