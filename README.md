# Corona-Virus-Prediction

## Intro
We are a group of students from Multimedia University Malaysia. We are considered as a beginner to Data Science but we are eager to learn and explore more about it. Therefore, we have started our trial project at Hacklytics 2021.

Coronavirus is spreading rapidly all over the world. We saw that Covid-19 definitely affected our life in many aspects, and it is important to know how long will COVID-19 last. Therefore we decided to utilize a model using linear regression to predict the growth of number of COVID-19 cases. 

## Dataset
- [US State-level Data](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) : the current Covid-19 cases in US from 2020 Jan 21 to 2021 Feb 4.

We started by doing some simple analysis of the dataset. After collecting some info, we have made a 10-days COVID-19 cases prediction by using linear regression. Our aim is not really to predict the future, but to learn more things related to Data Science field. We hope that we could get some feedback on our project, and we are also willing to learn in order to improve our project :D
